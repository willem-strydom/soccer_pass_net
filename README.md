# Final Project (fp)

Add your jupyter notebook (and all custom python modules) to this repo. Make sure the notebook is executed before your last commit prior to the fp deadline. 

## Data
Do **not** add the data to the repository. We will not **run** your notebook/code!
Reference the data source in your report. If you processed the data add the (documented) code (seperate jupyter notebook or python module(s)) used for processing to this repository (this will ideallly **not** be in the same notebook as your analsyis work) and briefley desribe the processing in your report.
